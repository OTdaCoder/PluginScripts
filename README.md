# PluginScripts
Here you'll find a bunch of scripts to uninstall plugins on MacOS, I got lazy uninstalling 
demos and old plugin files so I decided to just make scripts to do it for me
download, enjoy & if you have any to add go for it!

To make the script an executional file do the following!
1. Open terminal or Iterm on Mac.
2. Then paste the the following excluding "", "chmod +x "
3. drag and drop the .command file into terminal
4. Press enter
5. Exit terminal or iterm

If file doesnt open directly, do this .
1. Right click on file
2. Hold Option key "⌥" on mac, whilst left clicking "Open"
3. You will be prompted with the following, select "Open"
   "macOS cannot verify the developer of “Plugin.command”. Are you sure you want to open it?"

Executing the script
1. You will be prompted for your computer password (it won't display, just type)
2. Hit enter and process will begin
3. Once done you can exit
