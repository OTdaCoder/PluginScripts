# PluginScripts
Here you'll find a bunch of scripts to uninstall plugins on MacOS, I got lazy uninstalling 
demos and old plugin files so I decided to just make scripts to do it for me
download, enjoy & if you have any to add go for it!

Before you execute the script do the following!
1a. Open terminal or Iterm on Mac.
2a. Then paste the the following excluding "", "chmod +x "
3a. drag and drop the .command file into terminal
4a. Press enter
5a. Exit terminal or iterm

If file doesnt open directly, do this .
1b. Right click on file
2b. Hold Option key on mac "‚å•", whilst left clicking "Open"   

Executing the script
1c. Double click on the .command file (to uninstall plugin)
2c. You will be prompted for your computer password (it won't display, just type)
3c. Hit enter and process will begin
4c. Once done you can exit
