# PluginScripts
Here you'll find a bunch of scripts to uninstall plugins on MacOS, I got lazy uninstalling 
demos and old plugin files so I decided to just make scripts to do it for me
download, enjoy & if you have any to add go for it!

Before you execute the script do the following!
1. Open terminal or Iterm on Mac.
2. Then paste the the following excluding "", "chmod +x "
3. drag and drop the .command file into terminal
4. Press enter
5. Exit terminal or iterm

If file doesnt open directly, do this .
7. Right click on file
8. Hold Option key on mac "‚å•", whilst left clicking "Open"   

Executing the script
9. Double click on the .command file (to uninstall plugin)
10. You will be prompted for your computer password (it won't display, just type)
11. Hit enter and process will begin
12. Once done you can exit
